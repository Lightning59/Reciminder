# Reciminder

## What is Reciminder?
Reciminder is designed to be a self-hosted open source recipe catalogue that will feature meal-planning, grocery lists,
self reviews, and active reminders of recipes you said you liked but haven't made in a while.

### What makes Reciminder Different?
At the moment nothing - Right now it only gives you a form to type in recipes and then it archives them and allows some
very, very, basic search functionality. There are definitely better options out there both open and closed source.

### Why Reciminder then?
- None of the apps I've looked through do the recommendation process the way I'm truly looking for and I want to be able to tune it to my taste.
- I'd like to do this with a deterministic built in default, plus the ability to filter the results but then also eventually allow for users to tune their own algorithm or use LLM or other models as plugins to generate suggestions.
- I want an API that is open and allows easy integration via MQTT or HTTP with things like Home assitant or Node-Red out of the box.
- A lot of the other OS project I see for this type of app really seem to throw a lot at the "novice" user that may be coming from HA. I know I feel overwhelmed at how much and how the info is thrown at me for downloading and self hosting some of these apps. If I feel I have something at a maturity worth offering I would like to have a much more straightforward install approach for entry level Home assistant users say just taking their first baby steps into self-hosting docker apps.
- This is just a project I want to work on to gain experience in multiple areas.
